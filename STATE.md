# telltale — STATE

Where the project is right now. Read this before picking up work.

This file holds only what git and GitHub cannot tell you: intent, open
questions, and known gaps. For what landed, run `gh pr list --state merged`.
For when this file last changed, run `git log -1 STATE.md`. Neither is copied
here, because a hand-maintained copy of a derived fact is stale by the next
merge — this file has gone stale that way three times.

**Keep it true:** update *In flight* and *Open questions* when you land or hand
off work. `unknown` is a legal value; an honest blank beats a plausible guess.

## Current objective

Pre-v1. The active push is making `telltale council` usable as a daily driver:
one terminal, four seats, readable and steerable without opening four vendor
apps.

**The direction is recorded rather than remembered** (2026-08-06): council is
the product, the gauges are the infrastructure under it, and **v1 is held until
council settles**. Cutting v1 as gauges only was the standing alternative and it
is rejected. `README.md` and [docs/design.md §1](docs/design.md) hold the
binding copies and the argument; this file does not restate either.

## In flight

- **Blind rebuttal** is on `claude/council-herdr-relationship-8gr0s1` (ships with
  its PR): `ctrl+r` quotes now travel as "participant A/B/C", never vendor
  names — label-deep anonymisation, user-side attribution unchanged. Binding
  copy: [docs/design.md §9.34](docs/design.md).
- **Arena mode is DECIDED and not started** (2026-08-08, for the 9-30 demo):
  `/arena <brief>` per-turn isolation — each write-capable seat in its own
  worktree off the room's workspace; worktrees named by turn and kept until the
  user deletes them; comparison lands in-column as `git diff --stat` with the
  full diff yankable. The rulings and their reasons get recorded in design.md
  by the session that builds it; do not re-open the four forks without new
  evidence.

## Closed without code (do not re-open)

- **Tall-window content anchor** — **bottom**, ruled 2026-08-05. Short content
  sits above the composer and grows upward. Top-anchor is rejected; do not
  re-litigate. Contract: viewport geometry only; scroll-up freezes Follow; `G`
  restores; no jump on Done; long content keeps full-viewport scroll.
- **Focus hierarchy** — already shipped (`▸` + `Strong`, `hierarchy_test.go`).
- **`isDark` adaptive chrome** — won't-do. Council uses ANSI palette indices from
  `internal/theme`; the terminal resolves them against its own theme. The only
  background-dependent tokens in the repo are the HUD's gauge track
  (`ColorTrackLite` / `ColorTrackDark`), and council has no gauge. Wiring
  `lipgloss.LightDark` here would invent hues and break "Council adds no hues
  of its own" in `style.go`. The `_ = isDark` placeholder stays documented.
- **Negative routing** (`@all` minus a seat) — **shipped 2026-08-04**, and this
  file went on listing it as an unowned gap for two days afterwards. `-@vendor`,
  the expansion of `-@all` into a list of exclusions, and the refusal to mix the
  positive and negative forms are all in `mentions.go`, with
  `TestEveryAddressableVendorIsExcludable` pinning the vocabulary so a fifth
  seat cannot be added while `-@all` quietly goes on meaning four.

## Open questions

Nothing open. The last one here was the 44 seconds, and it was measured
2026-08-08; the finding and the unowned work left over from it are below.

## Known gaps, not yet owned

- **ATTRIBUTED, 2026-08-08. Spawning was never the cost; `wait` is, and only on
  the three seats that are not persistent.** One traced `@all` turn, all four
  seats, out of a live room's ring:

  ```
  claude spawn=-     wait=38ms     stream=6.443s   total=6.481s
  agy    spawn=18ms  wait=6.436s   stream=2.671s   total=9.125s
  cursor spawn=13ms  wait=10.864s  stream=14.137s  total=25.014s
  codex  spawn=30ms  wait=3.688s   stream=34.662s  total=38.38s
  ```

  **The standing diagnosis was right about the mechanism and wrong about the
  number.** "`cursor-agent` is spawned fresh per turn" is true — and its spawn is
  **13 ms, the cheapest of all four seats.** Process creation was never where the
  time went. What costs is `wait`: launch until the first line comes back.
  `cursor` pays **10.9 s** there, against a warm `claude`'s 38 ms — 286×. So the
  fix is not "make spawning cheaper"; there is nothing left in spawning to make
  cheaper.

  **~6 s looks like a CLI cold-start floor**, not a cursor problem alone: a cold
  `claude` measured 6.1–6.3 s (previous trace) and `agy` measures 6.4 s. `cursor`
  sits ~4.5 s ABOVE that floor and `codex` 2.4 s below it, so cursor is the one
  outlier worth a fix and codex is the fastest of the three to first byte.

  **What `wait` could not tell us has now been measured separately, and the
  split is in [design.md §9.33](docs/design.md).** `wait` bundled the vendor's
  own startup with the model's time-to-first-token; stamping raw stdout lines
  separates them, because `system/init` lands before the model is called.
  On `cursor-agent` **2026.08.04-aaa8809**, two trials per arm:

  - **~5.6 s** launch → `system/init` — pure CLI startup, no model involved. Of
    it, node is 0.08 s and loading the bundle ~1.13 s; the remaining ~4.4 s is
    the vendor resolving auth, config, trust and workspace.
  - **4.3–5.8 s** `init` → `result` — the model, confirmed by the vendor's own
    `duration_ms` on every trial. Persistence cannot touch this.
  - **~2.5 s** `result` → exit — the process lingers after answering.

  So **~8.1 s per turn is process cost and none of it is the model**, and it is
  paid again on every turn. `--resume` is NOT the expensive half: resumed
  startup (5.196 s, 5.551 s) is no larger than cold (5.666 s, 5.617 s), so
  restoring a conversation is free and the standing diagnosis was right.
  Proportion stated honestly rather than at its most flattering: 8.1 s is ~60%
  of a trivial turn but ~32% of the 25.0 s real turn traced above.

  **`claude` is the only vendor implementing `vendors.Persistent`** (the same
  interface `canGate` reads, which is why it is also the only seat that can be
  asked). Its own warm-vs-cold gap is measured at 38 ms vs 6.3 s. **Extending
  persistence to `cursor` is the highest-value optimisation available**, it now
  has a number behind it, and **the seam it needs has been found and driven
  live** — but it is a real feature, not a config change, and it is not owned.

- **UNOWNED, and no longer blocked on a question. The Cursor seat has a verified
  multi-turn seam: a `cursor-agent acp` subcommand that `--help` does not list.**
  Print mode can never be the channel — measured, it drains stdin to EOF and
  joins the whole of it into one prompt, so the EOF that starts a turn destroys
  the channel for the next. The hidden `acp` subcommand ("Start the Cursor Agent
  as an ACP (Agent Client Protocol) server") is JSON-RPC over stdio and was
  driven live: **two turns through one pid on one session, with the second turn
  costing 1.18 s against print mode's ~13 s**, because the ~8.1 s of process cost
  is paid once at `initialize` and never again.

  What stops this from being picked up as a mechanical port, and why it wants a
  session of its own: **ACP is a different protocol, not the same one with an
  open stdin**, so §9.8's shape does not mirror onto it. Three decisions are
  named in [design.md §9.33](docs/design.md) rather than guessed at — that
  `vendors.Persistent`'s stateless `Turn` cannot express ACP's handshake and that
  `runner.Session` correlates nothing (shared plumbing, not one adapter); that
  `cwd` and posture stop being argv-bound, which un-founds `persistent.go`'s
  respawn rules; and that every measured claim on this seat — the §9.6c dedup
  rule included — was measured against a surface ACP does not use.

  **A fan-out turn costs the SLOWEST seat, not the sum**: 38.4 s here, set by
  codex's 34.7 s of `stream` — which is the model working and not something to
  optimise. `claude` finished in 6.5 s and the room waited ~32 s for the rest.

  Method note, because it cost a round trip: `/trace` resolves a relative path
  against the ROOM's workspace, so a trace has to be named relative to the repo
  for anything confined to it to read the result.

- **The turn clock's concurrency is argued, not race-verified.** `-race` needs
  cgo, is unavailable on the machine the clock was written on, and is not in the
  CI gate either. The locking in `runner/clock.go` was reasoned through and
  reviewed; it has not been run under the detector.
- **CI actions are pinned to a deprecated runtime.** `actions/checkout@v4` and
  `actions/setup-go@v5` target Node 20, which now force-runs on Node 24.
  Cosmetic today, a broken gate eventually.

Cross-platform and cross-machine status has its own file: [PARITY.md](PARITY.md).

The conventions a fresh session would otherwise re-derive — golden-test traps,
commit voice, the honesty rules, the read/write boundary — are in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## How to re-enter

1. Read this file, then `PARITY.md` if you changed machines.
2. `gh pr list` for open work; `telltale hud` for live sessions.
3. Update *In flight* and *Open questions* in the same PR that changes them.
